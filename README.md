# Image to Latex

## Introduction

This respository implement the Seq2Seq Image to Latex architecture from paper “Image to Latex.” of Genthial, Guillaume. (2017).

## Architecture

This structure is based on Seq2Seq architecture, it use one Convolutional Encoder and one RNN Decoder.

- Convolution (only)
- Convolution with Row Encoder (BiLSTM)
- Convolution with Batch Norm
- ResNet 18 with Row Encoder (BiLSTM)
- ResNet 18 (only)
